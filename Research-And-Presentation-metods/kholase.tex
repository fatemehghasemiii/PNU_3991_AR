A recent Gilbert poll found that 85 percent of users delete  messages without reading them.Some also set up email filters to remove anonymous
senders,which makes it difficult for an e-researcher to reach the target populationThe electronic researcher must have time constraints and
Minimize the budget of each error as much as possible.

Reducing Electronic Error in Any Survey Despite the high accuracy of a sample,additional errors may occur.It is the responsibility of researchers to manage system error.Error reduces the value of accuracy and impact of any survey.
Measurement error can start in the design process.Accuracy in instructions and examples are useful ways to reduce measurement error.

\justifying	
Non-response error occurs when those who did not respond to the survey differ from those who did, which is relevant to the study study, such as determining the workload of managers.  In general, risk rewards and trust can be used to increase electronic response.
